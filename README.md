# Child_Mortality_Rate
The data was scrapped from various government websites and combined into one mega dataset. 
I did extensive data analysis on the dataset. Here I aim to see the effect of different variables upon the child mortality rate of different countries. In the end, I applied Linear Regression and tested assumption such as homoscedasticity and normality.
